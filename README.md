# BroncoID
This is a test inage recognition app for machine learning. This app will identify what generation of Ford Bronco is present in the image. It also works with international scouts. The model was trained with FastAI in python. Then the model was uploaded to hugging faces and a simple app was made with gradio. An API was generated that this html calls to identify the image.
